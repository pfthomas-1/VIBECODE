Naturally, you'll need something that can run java (JDK, online IDE, it doesn't matter)

The program is intended to run in a loop, which will continue as long as the player has credits to spend and doesn't choose to quit, but misjudgements in scope meant the project is currenlty in an unfinished state.
Before the game starts, it will ask you for your name and give you 15 credits to gamble.
When running the program, be mindful of what the program is requesting you input.
- when requesting the bet, please input a positive integer
- when requesting player action, the words "hit" or "stand" are the only valid inputs, entering anything else is managed

Hit: draw a card, if the total is greater than 21, the round is a bust
Stand: stop drawing cards and go to the dealer's turn

The dealer will hit until it has a total of at least 17, at which point it will either stand or bust.
