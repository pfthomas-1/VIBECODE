# VIBECODE

1. What did you build?
I tried to build a simplistic version of blackjack, but got a bit overambitious
2. What language(s) or tools did you use?
I used java, VSCode, and Gemini
3. Which AI tools did you use, and how?
I used Gemini to help me with methods I had no idea how to even begin to tackle (i.e. the code responsible for shuffling the deck).
4. What did you do versus what AI helped with?
The only thing I used AI for was to help create a shuffling algorithm, which I modified to accept an String array instead of an integer array.
5. What’s one thing you’re proud of?
I am proud of what I was able to do with the time I had available, but acknowledge that I bit off more than I can chew
6. What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?
Given more time, I would actually finish the logic for the dealer's turn, incorporate a post-game summary, and give the player the option to play more than one round
